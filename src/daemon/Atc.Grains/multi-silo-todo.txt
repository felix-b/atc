(1) Compare grain refs by silos:
    -> Include SiloId in GrainId
(2) Allow interaction between grains across silos
    -> Add SuperSilo to manage a map of silos
    -> Add SiloId parameter to grain lookup functions of ISiloGrains
    -> Create proxy for remote grains (return from ISiloGrains lookups)
(3) Minimize grains references to Silo or its services 
    -> Inject single ISilo into AbstractGrain instead of separate sub-services 
(4) Enable migration ("teleportation") of a grain graph into a different silo
    -> Serialize grains in the graph and materialize in another silo
    -> Translate grain refs during teleportation
