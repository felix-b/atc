# Welcome to virtual world of air traffic and control simulation [early development]

Our goal is to create a comprehensive and accurate ATC (air traffic control) simulation. We simulate both air traffic and the ATC units as two halves of a whole. The platform for user interaction is the [X-Plane flight simulator](https://www.x-plane.com/), where AT&C loads as a plugin and lets the user choose between 1st-person pilot or 1st-person controller experience. The project aims at adding both educational and entertainment value for X-Plane users. **[See demo video](https://youtu.be/VeK6mcrzLWk)**.
