# AT&C [early development, not yet playable]

## Welcome to the virtual world of air traffic and control simulation

Our goal is to create the most comprehensive and most accurate ATC (air traffic control) simulation. We simulate both air traffic and the ATC units as two halves of a whole. The platform for user interaction is the [X-Plane flight simulator](https://www.x-plane.com/), where AT&C loads as a plugin and lets the user choose between 1st person pilot or 1st person controller experience. The project aims at adding both educational and entertainment value for X-Plane users.
